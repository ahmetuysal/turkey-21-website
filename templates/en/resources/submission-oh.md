title: Submission/Office Hours

[TOC]

## Submission

Twice a day, you will submit your work from the session via Ed. **It is okay if you don't finish everything, or if you are still working.** We just want to know that you are keeping up with the material.

You will also need to submit your code if you attend office hours and are looking for debugging help. Section Leaders can then download your code and help you faster.

You can submit as many times as you want. You may want to submit multiple times if you attend office hours multiple times for debugging.

### How to submit

#### 1. Go to Lessons in Ed

Navigate to [Ed]({{config['discussion_forum_url']}}) Lessons, where you will submit your code.

  <p style="text-align:center"><b>Ed Lessons</b>: In the main CS Bridge class (not your Section), select the Lessons icon (looks like a book).</p>
</center>

#### 2. Select Submission

Click on the correct session that you would like to submit for (correct day and correct time, morning or evening). For example, for the first day, click on "Day 1 PM".

  <p style="text-align:center"><b>Submit portal</b>: On the Lessons page, click on the session you would like to submit for.</p>
</center>

#### 3. Upload

For each file you have, copy it from PyCharm using Select All (Mac OS X: ⌘-A, Windows: Ctrl-A) and then paste into the Ed editor (see the below images). **Do this for each file you want to submit** by clicking on the tabs.

You can also click on the plus (`+`) button in the Ed editor and directly upload your Python or Karel file into the editor.

Finally, click on "Submit" in the bottom-right corner to submit via Ed. You can submit multiple times, and Ed will save your work.

## Office Hours

Office Hours provide you with an opportunity to work on your daily projects alongside other students and to ask for help when you need it. You can either get help in an environment with others or you can get 1-on-1 help from a Section Leader. Office Hours are optional but highly encouraged if you have questions about any of the course elements. They're also a great way to interact with a Section Leader, to fix a bug in your code, and to gain a deeper understanding of the material. Other Section Leaders will be there, not just the one you are assigned. 
Go to the office hour Nooks link listed on the schedule in [Ed]({{config['discussion_forum_schedule_url']}}). If you want help with your code, follow the instructions above to submit your code to Ed so that a Section Leader can see it. 

* **Group Work** 

    * Come and hang out and join the Group Work room for what you are working on! Choose from the following options: **Conceptual Review**, **Lecture Review**, **Project Help**, **Quickstart Help**, and **Section Review** 
    * Other students will be there working and a Section Leader will be in that room too. As you are working, you can ask general questions and get advice if you are stuck.
    * This is a nice way to socialize with other students as you work on daily projects

* **1-on-1 Help** 

    * If you have a more in depth debugging question, sign up for 1-on-1 Help by joining the queue (see “View Queue”) and we will assign you to a room with a Section Leader as soon as we can.

If you run into any issues, just direct message the Head Section Leader (İrem in the afternoon and Ahmet in the evening) through Nooks by clicking the “Chat” tab at the left.

Happy debugging!
