[TOC]

### Description

CS Bridge is a collaboration between Stanford University in the United States, Koç University in Istanbul, and instructors and students from Izmir, Turkey. These lecturers and students have come together to teach high school students in Turkey how to code.

- It assumes **no prior programming experience.**
- This course will follow the **same schedule** each day (except for a few days where we have social activities).
- We've designed the course so that outside of the schedule, you do not need to be on your computer working on the course material. If you want to spend extra time because you're excited about the material, that's okay but it is not necessary.
- You will have weekends **off**.

We hope these course components will help you have a great CS Bridge experience:

- You will meet (via videoconferencing) <b>in a small group</b>, daily, with someone on the teaching team.
- The course is centered around <b>engaging assignments and projects</b> and other activities to help you meet other students and get to know the teaching team.
- You won't receive a grade in the course, so just enjoy learning and have fun!
- The main outcome is that you will have had A LOT of FUN and have acquired **a new and wonderful skill: how to program.**
- After you've finished the course, you will receive a certificate of completion.

### The CS Bridge Team

The CS Bridge Team is made up of a group of wonderful teachers in **two countries** - Turkey and the United States.

1. Lecturers - These people are current lecturers. You will hear from all of them as they take turns delivering lectures each day.
1. Section Leaders - These fun people are students from Stanford, Koç and universities in Izmir who are passionate about computer science and serve as great role models. You will be assigned to a small group led by a Section Leader. You'll get to know this person really well throughout the course!
1. Program Administrators - Each cohort of students (from Koç and Izmir) has a program administrator who manages the enrollment process and is the main point of contact between your families and the program. The CS Bridge Program Manager from Stanford, Yosefa Gilon, will be managing administrative components of the course.

Pre-pandemic, this program was run in-person. We have adjusted the program slightly so it could be offered online and this is the second year we are running CS Bridge as an online program.
Our goal is to create one community of enthusiastic teachers and students who support each other as you all learn a new and exciting skill!

<!-- Elements of the Course -->

### Elements of the Course

It is expected that you participate **fully** in the course. You must attend every activity on the schedule.

<!-- A. Lectures -->

#### A. <u>Lectures</u>

Lectures will be held **twice a day** - there will be one 40 minute lecture at the start of the day and one 40 minute lecture in the evening. Each lecture will be taught by a lecturer from one of the three universities. This is where you’ll learn the core concepts of the class.

- Lectures will be delivered **LIVE** through Zoom and will be recorded and posted on Ed so you can refer back to them later if you need to. What is Ed??? See the Course Communications section below!

<!-- B. Tea Time -->

#### B. <u>Tea Time</u>

This will follow the morning lecture each day.

- You will be assigned to a small group led by a Section Leader and will have the chance to get to know each other, play games, and talk about course and non-course related things. Due to the time difference, if your Section Leader is based in the United States, you will be assigned a different Section Leader for the morning tea time so you will socialize with a different group of students.
- Picture yourself drinking tea and sitting around a circle in a room getting to know each other!

<!-- C. Section -->

#### C. <u>Section</u>

In addition to two lectures per day, <b>you will also be attending a daily discussion section in small groups with a Section Leader.</b>

- This is where you’ll get to practice with the new concepts you learned in lecture.
- You will meet with the same group of students and will have the same Section Leader each day.

<!-- D. Office Hours/Work -->

#### D. <u>Office Hours/Work</u>

This is when you'll be able to ask for individual help on your code. We will be using Nooks, an online community in which no software is needed.Simply click on the Nooks community link and you will be directed to the office hours space.

- If you need help, you'll join the Office Hours Nooks community and Section Leaders will be there to answer your questions.
- You may have to wait in the Nook community until a Section Leader is free to help you.
- If you don't have questions, this is the time that you'll spend working on your assignments and there's no need to join Nooks.

<!-- E. Projects -->

#### E. <u>Assignments</u>

There will be two programming projects that you will work on each day. The core project questions are designed to be done individually but we encourage you to teach each other -- this includes guiding your peers towards the answer without “giving it away”.

- You will be expected to submit the first project by 14:00 each day and the second project by the end of the Office Hours/Work session in the evening at 23:00.
- Instructions for completing and submitting assignments will be posted on Ed.

<!-- F. Social Activities -->

#### F. <u>Social Activities</u>

We want you to learn a lot in this course but we also really want you to have **FUN** and to get to know students from different schools and areas! We also want you to get to know the Section Leaders, not just your own Section Leader!

- Each week there will be one large social activity for everyone involved in the course, we will host them at different times so check the schedule.
- These activities are part of the program so please plan to attend!
- We are going to try really hard to make this program memorable and a lot of fun and hopefully you'll turn off your computer on the last day knowing that you have a lot of new friends in different places!
