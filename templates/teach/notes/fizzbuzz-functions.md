problemTitle: Fizz Buzz

For this problem, students are focusing on parameters and return:

+ How to write a function that takes in parameters
+ How to write a function that returns something
+ How to call a function that takes parameters or returns something

Some students struggle with the difference between returning and printing as well.

**Note**: there is a fizzbuzz bonus problem for variables, but it is slightly different.  That one does not use parameters or return or user input.

Something that may help if students are confused is to help them implement `main()` _first_, and `fizzbuzz(n)` second.  This helps see how the function will be used, which can help orient students when it's time to implement the function - they can look back at its use to remember what it must take in, what it must return, etc.  The reverse approach also works - but it may be helpful to quickly outline what a call to the function might look like so that students understand its use.

When implementing `fizzbuzz`, a good milestone is to first approach how to use the parameter input, and just implement the function to print out the required output.  After they are done with this, then they can go back and figure out how to add the variable that they ultimately return.
